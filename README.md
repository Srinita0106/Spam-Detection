# Spam Detection Using Deep Learning

This project implements a spam detection system leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques and deep learning with TensorFlow/Keras. It classifies email or text messages as spam or non-spam (ham) through text preprocessing, tokenization, and a neural network model.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build an accurate classifier that identifies spam messages using machine learning. The pipeline includes:

- Data preprocessing and cleaning of raw text data
- Tokenization and padding sequences for input to neural networks
- Model building with TensorFlow/Keras for binary classification
- Training with validation monitoring and callbacks for optimal performance

The dataset consists of labeled messages with a spam label (1) or non-spam (0).

## Features

- Text cleaning to handle punctuation, stopwords removal, and normalization
- Visualization of data distribution and word clouds
- Sequence padding to create uniform input lengths
- Early stopping and learning rate reduction callbacks to improve training efficiency
- Model evaluation with accuracy metrics

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NLTK for natural language processing
- Pandas and NumPy for data management
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
